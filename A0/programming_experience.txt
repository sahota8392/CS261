How many years experience do you have with each?
For each language, which IDEs have you used?
What programming-related classes have you taken?

I've learned Python recently from CS161 and CS162 in the last two quarters and Javascript in a Bootcamp course about a
year ago. Therefore, my experience is very limited and at the beginner stage of approximately less than 6 months. I have
 only worked with Visual Studio Code and Pycharm. I have taken then into CS161/CS162 courses already, but alongside this
  course, I am taking CS290 Web Development where we will be working more in Visual Studio Code.
